# Lung Cancer Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning models to predict lung cancer based on patient symptoms, demographic data, and health indicators. The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for early lung cancer detection.

## Objective
To build and evaluate various machine learning models for binary classification of lung cancer presence (YES/NO) using clinical and symptomatic data.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Dataset
The dataset contains 16 features including:
- **Demographic**: Gender, Age
- **Symptoms**: Smoking, Yellow Fingers, Anxiety, Peer Pressure, Chronic Disease, Fatigue, Allergy, Wheezing, Alcohol Consuming, Coughing, Shortness of Breath, Swallowing Difficulty, Chest Pain
- **Target**: Lung Cancer (YES/NO)
